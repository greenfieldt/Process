#### Quick Thought on Process ####

At Increate Software we strive to use enough process to be effective
but not more than we need.  Over the years we've been involved with
projects using most software development processes used today, from
RUP to Agile.  We've seen them all work when used properly and all
fail when misunderstood.  We believe that the biggest mistake an
organization can make is to develop software with no process.  The
second biggest mistake an organization can make is making up their own
process.  This is because, today there is no need to invent your own
process,  better to use  your limited time creating product. 

#### The Outline of an Engagement ####

Our standard engagement begins with a free consultation.  During this
meeting we learn more about each other and your specific needs.  If we
choose to move forward with the engagement we will then schedule a
kickoff meeting with you and your team the objective of which is to
define enough information to begin work immediately.  After that we
will work and communicate with you at various levels of detail on a
daily, bi-weekly, and quarterly basis as described below.  

During the work you will be assigned a project manager and an
escalation POC (point of contact).  If at anytime you are unclear
about goals, progress, or status of any kind you can contact your PM
and if not satisfied with the response your escalation POC.  

As the work progress you will receive small working code updates on an
(at most) bi-weekly basis, usually sooner.  Any documentation work
products will be delivered to you in a format of your choosing or in
the output of one of our standard tools.  


## Software Development Paradigm ##
If you have already implemented a software development process we will
work within the system you have selected.  If you haven't selected a
software development process or you wish Increate Software to manage
the all aspects of the software development effort then we will
recommend a software development process based off of the SAFe Agile
framework.  


#### Time Frames ####


  * Product Road-map -- A long term product level view

  * Quarterly PIs -- A low detail plan for the next quarter of work

  * Sprint -- A high detail plan for the next 2 weeks of work

  * Daily Standup -- A daily recap of the progress, blockers, and next
steps

#### Essential Roles ####


  * Product Owner -- A person identified by your who is able to rank
competing features in order of importance and provide details of how
the product should work from a customer's perspective.


  * SCRUM Master / PM -- Increate Software will identify an individual
that will lead the day to day operations of the project, ensure good
tactical communication, and remove any roadblocks that happen during
the development.

  * Architecture / Designers -- Increate Software will provide the
necessary Architecture / Designers for your projects needs

  * Requirement Analyst -- Increate Software will provide the necessary
Requirement Analysts 

  * Developer / Testers -- Increate Software will provide the necessary
Developers / Testers for your projects needs

Note: Individuals may fill more than one role

## Consultation ##
The initial consultation is an essential meeting between primary
decision makers at your organization and Increate Software. The
objective of this meeting is share information about how we work and
what your project objectives are. Increate Software will introduce an
executive in charge of your account and record initial impressions of
the resources you may need.  We will offer you any suggestions or
impressions we have for your work and schedule next steps.

## Kickoff ##
In the time period between the initial consultation and the Kickoff
meeting Increate Software will review any written documentation
and/or industry specific information you may have

During the kickoff meeting we will introduce the Increate Team Members
to your team.  Identify essential team members and outline a
Sprint 0 which is a two week pre-sprint meant to accomplish meaningful
work while resources are getting up to speed.
